            <p>
              Katrina Dawn is a watercolour sketcher residing in the Fraser Valley, BC with her husband, Michael. Although she has dabbled in many different art mediums, the unpredictable and unforgiving nature of watercolour poses a unique challenge and has captured her interests now exclusively.
              Its portable nature lends itself to plein-air painting, which is Katrinaâ€™s preferred creative environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although naturally drawn to urban sketching, Katrina is frequently commissioned for both home and pet portraits.
              The challenge of depicting personal material in an authentic yet artistic manner is a welcome one.
            </p>
            <p>Katrina has also worked with a number of corporate clients, increasing brand awareness through an artistic rendering of their brands.</p>
