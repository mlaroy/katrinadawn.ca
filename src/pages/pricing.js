              I offer a number of standard sizes for commissions. My style involves including a 1‚Äù border of white around
              the painting to frame it with lightness and to capture the <em>gorgeous</em> edge that comes when watercolour dries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each size has a range of price depending on the complexity of the piece. All dimensions are in inches.
              Custom sizes can be accommodated. Prices listed are in Canadian dollars.
