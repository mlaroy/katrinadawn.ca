            <p>Katrina Dawn is a watercolour sketcher residing in the Fraser Valley, BC with her husband, Michael. Although she has dabbled in many different art mediums, the unpredictable and unforgiving nature of watercolour poses a unique challenge and has captured her interests now exclusively. Its portable nature lends itself to plein-air painting, which is Katrinaâ€™s preferred creative environment.</p>
            <p>Although naturally drawn to urban sketching, Katrina is frequently commissioned for both home and pet portraits. The challenge of depicting personal material in an authentic yet artistic manner is a welcome one.</p>
            <p>Katrina has also worked with a number of corporate clients, helping to raise brand awareness with their stakeholders through her commissions.</p>
