              While Katrina enjoys painting subject matter of her own choosing, she is often contacted for commissions.
              Commissions are subject matter of the customerâ€™s choosing, but over the years two prominent themes have emerged: Pet Portraits and Home Portraits. Below is a select sampling of watercolour sketches that Katrina has done over the years for clients on each theme. </p>
